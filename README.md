# üí´ About Me:
üß†+ü´Ä = ‚ú®<br><br>Full-time creative and knowledge-hungry. That's how I would define myself in one sentence. Since I can remember, there hasn't been a day when I wake up without an interest in learning something new. Insatiable mind.<br>At the age of twelve, I was gifted my first computer, and soon a new universe of possibilities opened up before me. I quickly left Paint behind to learn about different design software, and in no time, I was developing my first "humble" websites. I learned from a young age to be resourceful and self-taught, to research and get to work.<br>Over time, life and my creative side led me to study Graphic Design. When I finished those studies, the opportunity to scratch my itch for web development came knocking on my door, and I jumped at it without hesitation. A few months later, I can say that I have found the ideal sector for me.<br>Front-end development, in particular, allows me to merge two parts of myself and achieve the perfect balance: designing interfaces focused on detail satisfies my more creative side, while the very nature of this sector, in which there is always something to solve or learn, triggers constant stimulation in me. For all these reasons, I am in love with this sector. Passion and vocation. üíñ<br>Currently, I am open to job offers in this sector. At the same time, I continue or intend to train in the short/long term in:<br><br>üì≤UX/UI Design<br>üß©Vue<br>üõëAngular<br><br>In addition to perfecting my current knowledge in:<br><br>üìíJavaScript<br>ü©≥React<br>‚åöPHP<br><br>For any additional information, let's talk! ‚òï<br><br><strong>"Art challenges technology and technology inspires art." - John Lasseter</strong><br>
